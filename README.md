# Acoustic_energy_harvester
The aim of this project is to design a model of Helmholtz resonator which
could give maximum output(in terms of current output etc..) in real life
scenario(roads, railways).

Acoustic energy is the energy concerning the mechanical vibrations from its
components. The acoustics are mainly classified into environmental acoustics,
musical acoustics, ultrasounds, infrasound etc.. based on the source and frequency of
waves. Here, in this project the main concentration is on environmental acoustics.
Noise caused by roadways, aircraft and activities that are related to the environment
which releases sound into environment(unwanted noise) comes under environmental
noise(environmental acoustics). Therefore, the AEH(acoustic energy harvester) is a
model which absorbs this unwanted energy released into atmosphere(sound energy)
and coverts into electrical energy which we humans almost use every moment in our
lives. The importance and need of Acoustic energy harvester can be well understood
by looking at the advantages of using solar panels, wind mills etc. <br/>

Why do we need AEH? <br/>
- It absorbs the energy which is almost redundantly present in atmosphere and makes sense out of it! <br/>
- It helps in producing electric energy which can be either used instantly or stored for later use. <br/>

Statistics says that the contribution of fossil fuels in electric energy production is more than 70 percent. So, the use of acoustic energy harvester to produce electric energy ‘efficiently’ can save large amounts of fossil fuels which are non-renewable and can thereby contribute its part to decreasing environmental pollution. <br/>
